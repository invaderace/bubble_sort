From https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/bubble-sort

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).
> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]

passthough will always be n-1

list[list.index(item)+1] is the next item on the list
